# java-database-framework with cache


Does exactly what my other repo java-database-framework (ORM) does but provides internal caching and hence improves the speed of retrieval. 
Will be working for mysql only, at least as of now . :(

mysql connector is required on build path for library as is a dependency of it.
I do not own any rights for mysql connector,  though it is available for free at : https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.1.html
