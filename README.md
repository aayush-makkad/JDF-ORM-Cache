# java-database-framework


Working on developing a framework to easen up the process for backend development for ava applications by handling jdbc and sql commands 
on its own.

Just provide credentials, table and column identifiers and you are good to go . :)

The reason it/i am creating and parsing XMLs is to provide a two way approach to providing required parametrers, either you can call the functions with required parameters or you can edit the XMLs and provide the necesarry parameters there. 

Will be working for mysql only, at least as of now . :(

I do not own any rights for mysql connector,  though it is available for free at : https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.1.html
